# Scheduling-Algorithms
A Process Scheduler schedules different processes to be assigned to the CPU based on particular scheduling algorithms. There are six popular process scheduling algorithms
<ul>
  <li>First Come First Serve Scheduling</li>
  <li>Priority Non-Preemptive Scheduling</li>
  <li>Priority Preemptive Scheduling</li>
  <li>Round Robin Scheduling</li>
  <li>Shortest Job First Non-Preemptive Scheduling</li>
  <li>Shortest Job First Scheduling</li>
</ul>

## First Come First Serve Scheduling
FCFS considered to be the simplest of all operating system scheduling algorithms. First come first serve scheduling algorithm states that the process that requests the CPU first is allocated the CPU first and is implemented by using FIFO queue.

## Priority Scheduling
Preemptive Priority CPU Scheduling Algorithm is a pre-emptive method of CPU scheduling algorithm that works based on the priority of a process. In this algorithm, the editor sets the functions to be as important, meaning that the most important process must be done first. In the case of any conflict, that is, where there are more than one processor with equal value, then the most important CPU planning algorithm works on the basis of the FCFS (First Come First Serve) algorithm.

## Round Robin Scheduling
Round Robin is a CPU scheduling algorithm where each process is cyclically assigned a fixed time slot. It is the preemptive version of First come First Serve CPU Scheduling algorithm. Round Robin CPU Algorithm generally focuses on Time Sharing technique. 

## Shortest Job First Scheduling
Shortest job first (SJF) is a scheduling process that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute next. This scheduling method may or may not be preemptive. Significantly reduces the average waiting time for other processes waiting to be executed. The full form of SJF is Shortest Job First.
